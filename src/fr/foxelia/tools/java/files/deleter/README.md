# Files Deleter System

The files deleter system is a simple tool that allows you to delete files and directories recursively. It is useful when you want to delete a directory and all its content.

## Why I created this class ?

I created this class because I needed to delete a directory and all its content. This class was inspired by someone who answered an internet thread. I can't find the thread anymore, but I want to thank him for his help if he reads this.
